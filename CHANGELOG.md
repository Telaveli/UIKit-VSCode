  * A large number of snippets have recieved changes or minor tweaks. There are too many to list in this changelog, but any snippets which include multiple options will now utilize this new system.
* Added new method snippets to JS snippets. (e.g. `uk-modal-methods`, `uk-drop-methods`, etc.)
* Fixed a few broken snippets
